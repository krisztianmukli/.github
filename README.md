# Github Community Health Files

*Default [community health files](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file) 
for all my open-source projects.*

This repository defines the **default community guidelines**, **issue and pull 
request templates** that all of my project repositories automatically inherit, 
unless a given project overrides them with its own files.

The goal is to ensure that every project operates with consistent standards and 
contribution processes.

## What guidelines does it include?

- **Code of Conduct**: defines the expected behavior of contributors.
- **Contribution Guide**: instructions for contributors on how to participate in 
the project.
- **Governance Model**: describes the project’s governance structure (roles, 
responsibilities, decision-making).
- **Security Policy**: guidance on reporting vulnerabilities and handling 
supported versions.
- **Support and Help**: explains where and how users can request help, and what 
level of support the project can provide.

## What additional templates does it store?

- **Issue templates**: the following categories are distinguished, and the 
project does not accept other issue types:
    - bug reports
    - maintenance suggestions or issues
    - documentation suggestions or issues
    - feature requests
    - localization suggestions or issues
    - questions related to project usage
    - refactoring suggestions

- **Pull Request template**: defines the accepted structure and required 
sections for pull requests.

- **`CODEOWNERS`**: this file defines which individuals or teams are responsible 
for which files or directories across the organization’s repositories. GitHub 
uses this file to:
    - Automatically request reviews from the designated code owners
    - Enforce that merges require approval from code owners (if branch 
protections are configured)
    - Determine who maintains specific components or paths 

- **`FUNDING.yml`**: this file enables the display of sponsorship or funding 
links on GitHub repository pages.
