# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using this project? Here's how.

## How to get help

**GitHub Discussions** is the best place for questions, suggestions, or ideas 
related to the project. Please check first to see if your question has already 
been answered.

Use **Github Issues** exclusively for reporting **project-related bugs**, 
**feature requests**, and issues affecting the project's functionality.  They 
are not suitable for individual debugging tasks or solving problems in other 
projects.

For any usage questions that are **not specific to the project itself**, please 
ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead. By doing so, you are 
more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you will allow anyone else with 
the same question to find the answer. This also allows maintainers to focus on 
improving the project for others.

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. 📖 **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you 
can figure it out on your own. These should be located in a root `docs/` 
directory. If there is an example project, explore that to learn how it works to 
see if you can answer your question.

1. 💡 **Search for answers and ask questions on GitHub Discussions.** 
This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of 
the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

1. 📝 As a **last resort**, you may open an issue on GitHub to ask for help. 
However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you 
have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do 
not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our 
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What NOT to do 

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. ❌ Do not reach out to the author or contributor on social media or sending a 
direct message.

1. ❌ Do not email the author or contributor *(except in cases of [security breaches](SECURITY.md) or violations of the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))*.

1. ❌ Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an 
open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. 
Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community.✌️
