        ## 🚨 Security Notice

        If you believe you've found a **security vulnerability**, **DO NOT** submit it via a public issue.  
        Instead, please follow our [Security Policy](https://github.com/krisztianmukli/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

        🔐 You can email your findings **privately** to: **security@mukli.hu**

        This helps ensure vulnerabilities are disclosed **responsibly**, without exposing users to risk.
